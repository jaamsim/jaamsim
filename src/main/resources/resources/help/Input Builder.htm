<h2>Input Builder</h2>

</div>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Input Builder is a tool for
constructing inputs that involve expressions.  It is opened through the Input
Editor by clicking on the 'Input Builder' entry in the dropdown menu for a keyword.</p>

<p class=Main>The Input Builder has an auto-complete feature that provides a
menu of valid names for both objects and outputs.  The feature is activated by
entering a left square bracket (indicating the start of an object name) or a
period (indicating the start of an output name).  The menu becomes shorter as
the user enters any portion of the object's or output's name.  Hovering the
cursor over a menu item generates a pop-up description of the object or output. 
For an object, the description pop-up is generated from the input to its <span
class=KeywordChar>Description</span> keyword.</p>

<p class=Main>The input for a keyword that uses inner curly braces such as <span
class=KeywordChar>AttributeDefinitionList</span> or <span class=KeywordChar>RunOutputList</span>
can be spread over several lines in the Input Builder.  Line feeds are deleted
automatically when the input is accepted.  When an existing input is edited,
the input for each pair of curly braces is placed automatically on a separate
line.</p>

<p class=Main>The field at the bottom of the Input Builder shows whether or not
the present input is valid.  The present value for the input is shown if the
input is valid.  An error message is shown if it is not valid.  Only a valid
input can be accepted.</p>

<p class=Main>A button bar is provided that includes all the symbols and data
types that are used by the expression system's syntax.  The buttons provide
both a convenient way to enter the correct symbols as well as pop-up
descriptions that define the syntax and provide examples.</p>
